### UML
UML(Unified Modeling Language) is a way of visualizing and documenting a software system by using a collection of diagrams.
These diagrams are organized into two distinct groups: structural diagrams and behavioral diagrams.

### types
- Structural diagrams
  - **Class diagram**: backbone of object-oriented modeling, it shows how different entities relate to each other.

- Behavioral diagrams
  - **Use case diagram**: describe the high-level functional behavior of the system, answers what system does from the user point of view.
  - **Sequence diagram**: describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages over time and are used to explore the logic of complex operations, functions or procedures. 
  - **Activity diagram**: emphasizes the condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens.
